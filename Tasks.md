## How To: Tasks

### Creating Tasks (Custom tasks only)

At the top of the `Tasks` page is a create task form. You can give your task a name, you can give it some tags for better filtering, and if creating one task at a time is too slow, you can also upload tasks in JSON format. (Useful for sharing tasks with co-workers)

### Working with Tasks

Once you have signed in to JIRA, or uploaded/created some tasks, you can perform actions on them like starting the timer for the task, marking the task as "Work on Today", reseting the timer, or deleting the task.

### Saving JIRA worklogs

Not having to go back to JIRA to log your time on a task can be nice, especially when that important issue comes in and you don't have time to jump around the Internet to stop and start new tasks. Well just hit the Rocket icon in the task actions and your time will be logged and you can move on to other matters.
