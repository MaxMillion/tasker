# Tasker

Time Assistant is a very simple task runner that will verbally and visually notify you of currently running tasks. You can enable/disable either notification type (or both). You can also set the duration of time in between notifications.

### Quick Start Guide

*You must use chrome to run this app!*

In the directory you wish to install Tasker run `git clone git@github.com:kkemple/tasker.git tasker`

Then run `cd tasker`

**You must have Node.js installed to run this app!!**

If you do not have Node.js installed, you can get it [here](https://nodejs.org).

Now copy the following command in to the terminal to get the app set up `chmod 700 capture.sh && chmod 700 install.sh && ./install.sh`

Now, to start your server run `npm start`

In Chrome navigate to `https://localhost:8888` and you will be up and running with Tasker!

Helpful Tips:
- You can enable all of Tasker's great features on the "App Settings" page.
- In order to get Jira Tasks, on Jira Tasks screen you must enter your JIRA username, password, and JIRA url. (The url of your JIRA instance)
- Use the "Report Bug" link in the header if you discover something amiss! :smiley:

Contributions and input are strongly recommended!!
