# Tasker

Time Assistant is a very simple task runner that will verbally and visually notify you of currently running tasks. You can enable/disable either notification type (or both). You can also set the duration of time in between notifications. It will also only notify you if you are running a task.

### Quick Start Guide

*You must use chrome to run this app!*

In the directory you wish to install Tasker run `git clone git@github.com:kkemple/tasker.git "Tasker"`

Then run `cd "Tasker"`

If you have Node.js installed run `npm install` (if not go [here](http://nodejs.org) to download Node.js)

Now, to start your server run `npm start`

In Chrome navigate to `https://localhost:8888` and you will be up and running with Tasker!
