There are quite a few features that can be enabled and customized on the `App Settings` page. Use the guide below to get up to speed on all that Tasker has to offer.

![App Settings Guide](https://github.com/kkemple/tasker/wiki/img/app-settings.jpg)

1. **Enable Browser Notifications**: This turns on Chrome's destop notifications, when you are tracking a task and the Tasker tab becomes hidden, it will send desktop notifications instead of in app notifications.

2. **Enable Voice Notifications**: When enabled you will get an auditory alert as well as a visual alert.

3. **Enable Screen Capture**: In order for Screentime to take snapshots of your screen you must enable this feature. There will soon be a setting that allows you to choose a time of day to record your screen so you don't have to always remember to turn it on and off.

4. **Backup Local Storage**: There may be times when you want to back up all the app information in your localStorage (for more on this see the [Storage][Storage] page of the wiki), this will instantly back up your localStorage instead of waiting for the auto backup.

5. **Restore Local Storage**: This will read all of the app info in your backup and place it in localStorage for you. It will then refresh the page in 20 seconds to repopulate the app, or you can click the refresh button in the growl notification.

6. **Notification Duration**: This is the amount of time in minutes that will pass in between each task alert. Task alerts only happen when a task or tasks are active (being timed).

7. **Backup Duration**: This is the amount of time in minutes that will pass between localStorage backups. This way you don't have to do it manually all the time and you will always have a recent backup.
